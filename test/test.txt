1/17/17, 11:02 PM - Jason Qarana: We have ebron
1/17/17, 11:05 PM - Ziad Shounia: Julius sucks. But he's still better than ebron
1/17/17, 11:06 PM - Ziad Shounia: Julius did well when he had a good qb. Ebron drops too many balls
1/17/17, 11:20 PM - Jason Qarana: Tight end position is not just for catching.
1/17/17, 11:20 PM - Ziad Shounia: I understand

1/17/17, 11:21 PM - Jason Qarana: We need offensive line
1/17/17, 11:21 PM - Ziad Shounia: Ebron sucks. No one can actually defend him
1/17/17, 11:21 PM - Jason Qarana: And that is the only position we should work on
1/17/17, 11:21 PM - Ziad Shounia: It's not like we are wasting a pick on him
1/17/17, 11:22 PM - Ziad Shounia: He'll be free agent
1/17/17, 11:29 PM - Jason Qarana: Money
1/17/17, 11:29 PM - Jason Qarana: What you gonna do with ebron?
1/18/17, 6:33 AM - Ziad Shounia: Thomas won't demand too much money because he's not even worth trading lol. I'm guessing ebron isn't costing too much in salary either. It won't hurt to have options at te.

1/20/17, 5:06 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: If manziel came back as a kicker Brandon would pick him up and claim kickers were useless again...
1/20/17, 5:06 PM - Jason Qarana: Only if he was a backup

1/27/17, 10:20 PM - Ziad Shounia: Lol dang that bad
1/27/17, 10:20 PM - Bashar: Not from the racist thing.... Just been swamped.
1/27/17, 10:20 PM - Ziad Shounia: No I get it
1/27/17, 10:21 PM - Ziad Shounia: You were saying you've been out of it
1/27/17, 10:21 PM - Ziad Shounia: That's cray cray

1/27/17, 10:22 PM - Bashar: They asked me for my availability earlier in the week and I said Friday afternoon.... But today no one called me...so obviously I must have not been that critical to the discussion.  Lol
1/27/17, 10:23 PM - Ziad Shounia: You guys don't do calendar invites?
1/27/17, 10:23 PM - Bashar: Ford doesn't support Google Calendar

1/27/17, 10:24 PM - Ziad Shounia: I would be lost without it. Especially with my new job
1/27/17, 10:24 PM - Ziad Shounia: I'm in meetings all day now
1/27/17, 10:25 PM - Tom Brady: Ronald McCarthy is on my list now
1/27/17, 10:25 PM - Raymond Brikho: Friends list
1/27/17, 10:25 PM - Ziad Shounia: Dude Ronald is scary
1/27/17, 10:25 PM - Bashar: It was on my Calendar...... But I got pulled off a program to move into another one so my calendar is twice as full as meetings and I'm getting calls and questions from both all day ....so I completely forgot this was a meeting I was supposed to call in to
1/27/17, 10:26 PM - Bashar: Ronald is just a normal white guy
1/27/17, 10:26 PM - Ziad Shounia: Lol
1/27/17, 10:26 PM - Bashar: What makes the shit he posts any different than what lajoy posts all day?
1/27/17, 10:27 PM - Bashar: Only difference is he singled out my comment on a channel 4 thing.....Out of hundreds.....snooped on my profile.... And shared a picture
1/27/17, 10:27 PM - Tom Brady: Luh-wha posts so much shit I had to unfollow him
1/27/17, 10:27 PM - Ziad Shounia: Not looking at exactly what brad posts specifically (aside from looking at his page earlier), there is a huge difference
1/27/17, 10:27 PM - Tom Brady: Probably jacked off to that pic first
1/27/17, 10:28 PM - Ziad Shounia: Brad is annoying with political posts, but not to a racist level (again only based on reading couple things while trying to find the gf pregnant post)
1/27/17, 10:28 PM - Tom Brady: Ronald probably got his middle school degree and married his sister
1/27/17, 10:28 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: Hold on who the fuck is that Ronald guy
1/27/17, 10:29 PM - Tom Brady: And his Michigan posts
1/27/17, 10:29 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: I never heard this story
1/27/17, 10:29 PM - Ziad Shounia: Do you see the pic that bashar posted from my wedding?

1/27/17, 10:30 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: I see it but who is he? And is that all he did?
1/27/17, 10:30 PM - Tom Brady: Damn
1/27/17, 10:31 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: I'm thinking it may be a joke but who knows
1/27/17, 10:31 PM - Tom Brady: Be a racist asshole? Yeah that's all he did
1/27/17, 10:31 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: Someone you knew previously?
1/27/17, 10:31 PM - Ziad Shounia: He's a random guy that doesn't know any of us. He saw a post that bashar wrote about trump, looked through Bashar's pics and shared his pic with the comment fbi watch list lol
1/27/17, 10:32 PM - Bashar: I made the stupid stupid move of posting on a channel 4 thing about trump.... Didn't even say anything that instigatory.... Some people replied but there were hundreds of other comments.... Later in the day I get a notification that this dude shared my pic (and I thought I had all privacy settings on.... Guess not).  Dude snooped on my profile and shared that pic of all the chaldo and said "blah blah fbi watch list"
1/27/17, 10:33 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: Hahahahaha the guys profile pic is Harambe!?
1/27/17, 10:33 PM - Ziad Shounia: All chaldo + 1 Canadian
1/27/17, 10:34 PM - Bashar: I knew I shouldn't have posted on that channel 4 thing the second I posted..... I've read some of those comments and all are idiots.... Whether liberal or conservative..... I regret ever stooping to that level....
1/27/17, 10:34 PM - Raymond Brikho: üëÜüèæ
1/27/17, 10:34 PM - Tom Brady: But your post was on point
1/27/17, 10:34 PM - Ziad Shounia: Lesson learned
1/27/17, 10:34 PM - Bashar: First and only time I'd ever do that
1/27/17, 10:35 PM - Ziad Shounia: It doesn't matter. People that comment on a Com box ate usually idiots lol

1/27/17, 10:36 PM - Ziad Shounia: Jakes toilet paper is actual Benjamins

1/27/17, 10:37 PM - Ziad Shounia: Except the lips part
1/27/17, 10:37 PM - Ziad Shounia: Too small
1/27/17, 10:37 PM - Bashar: Trying to impress his girl
1/27/17, 10:37 PM - Raymond Brikho: <Media omitted>
1/27/17, 10:38 PM - Ziad Shounia: Why is she paki?
1/27/17, 10:38 PM - Bashar: There ya go
1/27/17, 10:38 PM - Bashar: She's haram
1/27/17, 10:38 PM - Raymond Brikho: She's Indian lol
1/27/17, 10:38 PM - Ziad Shounia: Spot on now
1/27/17, 10:38 PM - Raymond Brikho: Being paki would be a bad thing

1/27/17, 11:13 PM - Jakob Yonan: Should have ate 43 wings
1/27/17, 11:23 PM - Bashar: Maria's eating for two Jake..... Not you
1/27/17, 11:23 PM - Bashar: Marwa *
1/27/17, 11:44 PM - Ziad Shounia: Marwa is not even eating for one, so he's compensating

1/28/17, 8:47 AM - Jakob Yonan: Trump is no joke lol
1/28/17, 8:47 AM - Bashar: All executive orders
1/28/17, 8:48 AM - Jakob Yonan: I know but still
1/28/17, 8:48 AM - Bashar: When he has a Republican majority in house and senate... Why does he need to rely on executive orders to do anything
1/28/17, 8:48 AM - Jakob Yonan: He is aggressive
1/28/17, 8:48 AM - Bashar: Obama uses them heavily in the past 4 years because Congress was stonewalling anything he was trying to accomplish with
1/28/17, 8:48 AM - Jakob Yonan: Because law makers have no balls
1/28/17, 8:49 AM - Bashar: Yeah,  Hillary Clinton sure didn't...
1/28/17, 8:49 AM - Bashar: Neither does Elizabeth warren
1/28/17, 8:49 AM - Bashar: They're just pussies
1/28/17, 8:50 AM - Bashar: They'll get grabbed left and right in Congress
1/28/17, 8:51 AM - Brandon Keina: Obama averaged 35 Executive orders per year, the last person to use less was grover Cleveland 1888
1/28/17, 8:53 AM - Jakob Yonan: So far with exception of Mexico I'm with everything trump has done
1/28/17, 8:53 AM - Bashar: And trump has?  12 in a week?
1/28/17, 8:55 AM - Brandon Keina: First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out‚Äî
Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out‚Äî
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out‚Äî
Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me‚Äîand there was no one left to speak for me.
1/28/17, 8:55 AM - Brandon Keina: That's what I think of every time people say ban Muslims and put them on a registry
1/28/17, 8:56 AM - Bashar: üëÜüèº
1/28/17, 8:56 AM - Bashar: But BK,  he's going to allow the Christians in.... So it's OK to z and jake
1/28/17, 8:57 AM - Bashar: Just like Jesus taught us...  Go forth brothers,  and ostracized and be racist towards other people
1/28/17, 8:57 AM - Bashar: That's right in the Bible,  Amirite
1/28/17, 8:57 AM - Brandon Keina: This Jesus guy sounds kind of nice. Seems like he wanted everybody to just get along or some shit
1/28/17, 8:58 AM - Bashar: New..... That Jewish Arab was clearly only referring to Caucasian Americans when was saying all that shit
1/28/17, 8:58 AM - Bashar: Only Caucasian Americans get along
1/28/17, 8:58 AM - Bashar: And he said that 2000 years ago...  Really ahead of his time
1/28/17, 8:58 AM - Bashar: Naw*
1/28/17, 8:59 AM - Brandon Keina: I wish he could come back and give Z and Jake a divine pimp smack
1/28/17, 9:00 AM - Bashar: https://youtu.be/Ge45R9qoW_Y
1/28/17, 9:01 AM - Brandon Keina: Lmao
1/28/17, 9:05 AM - Brandon Keina: Be thankful your kid won't be old enough to need to go to school when his idiot is in charge of education
1/28/17, 9:06 AM - Bashar: Jake's rich..... He'll put his kids in expensive private schools..... Fuck everybody else though # Republicans
1/28/17, 9:07 AM - Brandon Keina: White people won't let him in. He'll have to find an Arab Christian private school. #segregation
1/28/17, 9:11 AM - Bashar: Come on Brandon..... Obviously ever white person in this country clearly can tell the difference between a Christian Chaldean and a Muslim Arab...... I mean we're all so clearly different.
1/28/17, 9:11 AM - Bashar: Every*
1/28/17, 9:11 AM - Brandon Keina: Ronald sure as fuck can't. And he doesn't care
1/28/17, 9:12 AM - Bashar: McIntyre didn't know what a Chaldean was the first time we had a 1 on 1
1/28/17, 9:12 AM - Bashar: I had to explain it
1/28/17, 9:12 AM - Bashar: I even had to ask him "didn't you grow up in SE Michigan?"
1/28/17, 9:14 AM - Brandon Keina: Z go message Ronald and explain what a chaldean is to him. I'm sure he's an open minded individual he'll understand

1/28/17, 9:19 AM - Jakob Yonan: Go to Dearborn and see what they do
1/28/17, 9:20 AM - Jakob Yonan: One guy marries one and has kids with 3 other "girlfriends" that all collect welfare and food stamps
1/28/17, 9:21 AM - Bashar: Almost everyone in this chat was an immigrant at some point,   jake
1/28/17, 9:21 AM - Bashar: Including you
1/28/17, 9:22 AM - Bashar: There are always some bad apples in every system....yes there are people who take advantage of welfare and unemployment..... Doesn't mean you should remove the benefits from the millions that rely on it to turn their lives around
1/28/17, 9:23 AM - Bashar: Just like there are some bad ceos that do insider trading..... Would you argue that all ceos should not be able to invest at all?

1/28/17, 9:25 AM - Bashar: Coupled with the fact of.... Why the fuck would a terrorist go through a 5+ year refugee system that has,  literally,  dozens of checks in the system..... Just to sneak in and carry out an attack?  That is literature the most inefficient way to do it
1/28/17, 9:25 AM - Raymond Brikho: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 9:26 AM - Bashar: This ban isn't preventing terrorism....ita preventing innocent  bystanders,  families,  and children,  who are trying to flee oppression and war
1/28/17, 9:27 AM - Bashar: And this ban is an ignorant way for self righteous people in this country to be racist,  even if not intentionally,  under the guise of patriotism
1/28/17, 9:27 AM - Bashar: #dropsmic

1/28/17, 9:30 AM - Brandon Keina: This is literally in the isis handbook. If they get people to isolate Muslims more will retaliate and learn to hate western culture. It turns into a them versus us mentality. Then isis says 'look Americans and Europeans hate Muslims'
1/28/17, 9:31 AM - Bashar: Allahu akhbar!!
1/28/17, 9:31 AM - Raymond Brikho: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 9:31 AM - Bashar: I agree.... I wrote that chapter in the handbook
1/28/17, 9:31 AM - Brandon Keina: Ray with the comedic relief lol
1/28/17, 9:32 AM - Bashar: Not my best work though..    My chapter on  beheading techniques was much better.
1/28/17, 9:32 AM - Bashar: OMG....Ronald was right about me all along..... I should have never been allowed to immigrate into this country
1/28/17, 9:32 AM - Bashar: Why couldn't trump have been president in '96!!??
1/28/17, 9:33 AM - Brandon Keina: A reading from the book of revelations according to Bashar. Ramen.

1/28/17, 9:34 AM - Jakob Yonan: I did not read everything because u guys for heated ... but there is a difference when there are a few apples when 90% do this
1/28/17, 9:34 AM - Jakob Yonan: By the way it's not me making shit up
1/28/17, 9:34 AM - Jakob Yonan: My Muslim friends tell me this
1/28/17, 9:34 AM - Raymond Brikho: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 9:34 AM - Brandon Keina: That's one massive alternative fact
1/28/17, 9:34 AM - Bashar: 90%? [citation needed]
1/28/17, 9:35 AM - Brandon Keina: You get your statistics from trump?
1/28/17, 9:35 AM - Bashar: Lmao
1/28/17, 9:35 AM - Bashar: Way to pull  numbers out of the air Jake.... Jfc
1/28/17, 9:35 AM - Jakob Yonan: U guys have no idea
1/28/17, 9:35 AM - Jakob Yonan: Do u guys have Muslim friends in Dearborn
1/28/17, 9:35 AM - Bashar: I can make shit up too..... 90% of Chaldeans are terrorists
1/28/17, 9:35 AM - Jakob Yonan: And I don't mean moderate
1/28/17, 9:36 AM - Brandon Keina: I had Muslim friends all throughout my childhood and through high school. You're just racist
1/28/17, 9:36 AM - Jakob Yonan: My one Muslim friend told me shit that made me raise my eye drops
1/28/17, 9:36 AM - Bashar: Everyone wait.... Jake is about to make another "I watched 3/4 of a game"  argument
1/28/17, 9:36 AM - Bashar: Get your recorders ready
1/28/17, 9:36 AM - Bashar: There it is
1/28/17, 9:36 AM - Brandon Keina: This is literally trump speaking. "one guy's said some shit it's a fact"
1/28/17, 9:36 AM - Bashar: Bodum tiss
1/28/17, 9:36 AM - Bashar: My one friend tells me = literally 90%
1/28/17, 9:37 AM - Bashar: #jakelogic
1/28/17, 9:38 AM - Bashar: I have a friend that told me Brock osweiller is not a bad QB.... Luckily I have critical reasoning skills and don't believe all the stupid shit my friends tell me all the time.

1/28/17, 10:06 AM - Jakob Yonan: @15864800261 @17342865151 what I don't get is that u think it's racist when you no truly practicing Muslim friends ... u have no got to see what they believe in ... a practicing Muslim friend is one that prays 5x a day and goes to Dearborn mosque ... one that when u visit him at his house does not allow you to see his wife
1/28/17, 10:06 AM - Jakob Yonan: They are the ones telling me this
1/28/17, 10:06 AM - Jakob Yonan: That they plan to marry more than one wife and collect welfare and food stamp
1/28/17, 10:07 AM - Jakob Yonan: By having Muslim friends that drink beer and eat pork does not make them a practicing one
1/28/17, 10:08 AM - Jakob Yonan: When u truly don't have
1/28/17, 10:08 AM - Jakob Yonan: *
1/28/17, 10:13 AM - Brandon Keina: You're legitimately stupid. You make broad sweeping generalization about an entire religion based on the stupid minority. You had pre marital sex, that makes you just as much a hypocrite.
1/28/17, 10:14 AM - Jakob Yonan: My last comment ... u don't look at the other side ... just one sided argument discussion with u and Bashar
1/28/17, 10:14 AM - Jakob Yonan: I'm done
1/28/17, 10:14 AM - Jakob Yonan: Happy Saturday everyone
1/28/17, 10:15 AM - Brandon Keina: Funny, I don't see where I ignored anything
1/28/17, 10:16 AM - Jakob Yonan: Don't even start
1/28/17, 10:16 AM - Jakob Yonan: Lol
1/28/17, 10:19 AM - Raymond Brikho: Ford is trash
1/28/17, 10:19 AM - Raymond Brikho: Just like GM
1/28/17, 10:21 AM - Brandon Keina: You're a perfect example of somebody isis loves. You buy into the narrative that all Muslims are bad and spread hate. You think they're all terrorists and should be registered or banned from the US entirely. Then you cause those same Muslims that had nothing against western culture to despise us in retaliation and cause more people to join their cause. You're literally their favorite type of person, and you help them every time you say stupid shit generalizing all Muslims
1/28/17, 10:22 AM - Brandon Keina: You're literally a tool
1/28/17, 10:22 AM - Ziad Shounia: You do know that Obama has a registry for immigrants already, right?
1/28/17, 10:23 AM - Brandon Keina: To what degree? Banning immigrants from 7 countries? Forcing US citizens to go on a Muslim registry? Not the same thing.
1/28/17, 10:23 AM - Brandon Keina: Also who said I agreed even if it was true. Don't deflect.
1/28/17, 10:24 AM - Ziad Shounia: Not deflecting, just stating that all immigrants are registered. That's a procedure all around the world
1/28/17, 10:24 AM - Ziad Shounia: No one has said American citizens will be on a registry. That will never happen
1/28/17, 10:25 AM - Ziad Shounia: I would totally be against that
1/28/17, 10:25 AM - Ziad Shounia: Regardless for whom it is
1/28/17, 10:26 AM - Ziad Shounia: The countries he's banning are all in turmoil and chaos. They have a lot of terrorists (or terrorists are ruling the country or parts of it)
1/28/17, 10:27 AM - Ziad Shounia: He's not banning all muslim countries
1/28/17, 10:27 AM - Brandon Keina: We've bombed or invaded 6/7 of those countries, and even are currently bombing some. So now we ban them because their countries are in turmoil. Makes sense.
1/28/17, 10:28 AM - Brandon Keina: Also turmoil ! = terrorist by default
1/28/17, 10:29 AM - Ziad Shounia: True, which is why I mentioned both.
1/28/17, 10:29 AM - Ziad Shounia: Egypt is in turmoil but we didn't ban them
1/28/17, 10:30 AM - Brandon Keina: I wholeheartedly agree if we can't find sufficient background on individuals of any race or religion they shouldn't be allowed in. But this is a blanket ban.
1/28/17, 10:30 AM - Ziad Shounia: Lebanon has terrorists holding on the south, but we didn't ban them
1/28/17, 10:31 AM - Ziad Shounia: If these countries declared war on the us,would you be for it? (For a second assume that there was no specific religion,just a country)
1/28/17, 10:31 AM - Ziad Shounia: Like north Korea
1/28/17, 10:31 AM - Ziad Shounia: As an example
1/28/17, 10:32 AM - Brandon Keina: North Korea absolutely not if it was avoidable. The people in that country would be a burden to China and all the surrounding countries. If we tear Kim down we'd be forced to take them in. Unless we have a plan for that I'm against it
1/28/17, 10:33 AM - Brandon Keina: It'll be Iraq 2.0
1/28/17, 10:33 AM - Mike Gardner: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 10:33 AM - Brandon Keina: Lmao
1/28/17, 10:34 AM - Tom Brady: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 10:35 AM - Ziad Shounia: What I meant to say is, suppose they declared war today. We haven't done anything yet (we didn't attack them or plan to). Would you be in favor of not allowing north Koreans of entering the country? (Btw, I think we already don't allow them unless they were political asylum)
1/28/17, 10:35 AM - Mike Gardner: Lmao I love your bitmoji Tom.
1/28/17, 10:35 AM - Mike Gardner: Spot on.
1/28/17, 10:35 AM - Tom Brady: Thanks Mike, yours is solid too. Welcome to the club
1/28/17, 10:35 AM - Mike Gardner: I have had one forever just finally spamming the chat with it!
1/28/17, 10:36 AM - Tom Brady: Noice
1/28/17, 10:36 AM - Tom Brady: Link it to snap chat
1/28/17, 10:37 AM - Mike Gardner: Good idea
1/28/17, 10:37 AM - Tom Brady: Then we can make couples ones link Ray and I
1/28/17, 10:37 AM - Brandon Keina: This triggers nato (assuming trump doesn't withdraw from it). We and other nato members would have to take in North Koreans.
1/28/17, 10:38 AM - Brandon Keina: There's not really many options if any of them formally declared war
1/28/17, 10:39 AM - Ziad Shounia: Those countries that trump mentions, have significant parts held by terrorists groups and have declared war on the us
1/28/17, 10:40 AM - Brandon Keina: This is fear mongering. I don't walk around afraid of a terrorist attack all day. The vast majority of people that come from those countries aren't terrorists.
1/28/17, 10:40 AM - Ziad Shounia: The only difference is this terrorists groups are not accepted by the martial community as being official governments
1/28/17, 10:41 AM - Ziad Shounia: International*
1/28/17, 10:42 AM - Ziad Shounia: Somalia and Yemen don't have real governments any more
1/28/17, 10:43 AM - Ziad Shounia: The issue is it's not possible to differentiate between who is allegiant to the terrorists governments or not
1/28/17, 10:44 AM - Brandon Keina: As I said. If you have no history or information on people immigrating here I agree, don't let them in. I don't think a blanket ban is going to solve anything. There aren't bombings across the US every day. We'll succeed in fostering fear and hatred more than anything else.
1/28/17, 10:45 AM - Raymond Brikho: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 10:46 AM - Brandon Keina: I'm more afraid of police and abuses of government power than I am of terrorists
1/28/17, 10:46 AM - Ziad Shounia: Lol. That's because you didn't live in a country with terrorists
1/28/17, 10:47 AM - Ziad Shounia: I grew up there. I know what they are capable of. I almost died twice in Iraq before I got here (one was a bombing and the other was shooting)
1/28/17, 10:48 AM - Ziad Shounia: And one time they bombed 5 out of the 6 churches in my neighborhood. Luckily we were in the church that didn't get bombed
1/28/17, 10:49 AM - Ziad Shounia: So 3 different instances
1/28/17, 10:51 AM - Ziad Shounia: This is fear mongering way more than threat of terrorism. Look at what's happening in Europe last year. Or even in our own soil the past few years (but ours were mild in comparison aside from the Boston marathon)
1/28/17, 10:58 AM - Brandon Keina: No, it's not. When everyday police have military grade weapons and armor that's not fear mongering. No knock raids, civil forfeiture, government surveillance expansion, lack of accountability for police violence and killings or charges being pressed. That's very real.
1/28/17, 11:00 AM - Brandon Keina: All of those things I listed are very real. You being a victim of a terror attack is far less likely, I'd bet a lot of money on that.
1/28/17, 11:01 AM - Ziad Shounia: Yes currently it's highly unlikely, but let's not increase the odds by allowing an easy was for terrorists to come in
1/28/17, 11:02 AM - Brandon Keina: http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-02-14-noknock14_ST_N.htm I don't see 70-80 thousand terrorist attacks a year. But you're more likely to have police burst into your house without warning
1/28/17, 11:02 AM - Brandon Keina: So yes, I'm way more afraid of that than terrorists
1/28/17, 11:04 AM - Mike Gardner: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 11:05 AM - Ziad Shounia: If they have a warrant, then it's justified. I'm not saying we don't need reform for police and justice system, but that will need time to come up with it. The executive order, which is temporary for 3 months, is needed to prevent any possible terrorists until congress passes a measure
1/28/17, 11:05 AM - Brandon Keina: It's bull shit. How many terrorist attacks have we had in the last 8 years?
1/28/17, 11:06 AM - Brandon Keina: Like actual isis terror plots, not isis claiming responsibility for everything
1/28/17, 11:09 AM - Ziad Shounia: How do you think the Boston bomber learn how to make a bomb? At school? Lol
1/28/17, 11:09 AM - Ziad Shounia: He learned from isis/alqaida websites
1/28/17, 11:11 AM - Brandon Keina: He was from a country that isn't even on that list of banned countries. You can learn to make anything on the Internet, that argument is irrelevant.
1/28/17, 11:12 AM - Brandon Keina: So again, tell me where the terror attacks are from people from those countries are. On American soil. While we haven't had this ban for 8 years
1/28/17, 11:14 AM - Jakob Yonan: @12484174902 don't waste ur effort ... Brandon and Bashar think that when they come here they will drop their ninja suits and adopt American society and values
1/28/17, 11:14 AM - Brandon Keina: Care to answer my question Jake?
1/28/17, 11:14 AM - Brandon Keina: Since we're all in mortal peril.
1/28/17, 11:15 AM - Ziad Shounia: Weren't the California attack from Yemen?
1/28/17, 11:15 AM - Ziad Shounia: Let me look at some other examples and see where they are from
1/28/17, 11:17 AM - Brandon Keina: Please do. And look up how many other immigrants came from those countries in the last 8 years that haven't been terrorists.
1/28/17, 11:18 AM - Ziad Shounia: Again, no one is saying all of them are terrorists. But the possibility is much higher in those countries than other muslim countries
1/28/17, 11:19 AM - Ziad Shounia: If it was up to Jake for example, he would not allow Saudis to come in lol
1/28/17, 11:20 AM - Raymond Brikho: Ninja suits üòÇüòÇ
1/28/17, 11:20 AM - Ziad Shounia: But they don't have any terrorists group in their own soil
1/28/17, 11:21 AM - Brandon Keina: What about Catholics in those countries. Are they banned too? Like I said, find me immigration stats from each of those countries to terror attacks performed by people from those countries.  There's going to be like a 0.00001% chance of them being a terrorist
1/28/17, 11:22 AM - Brandon Keina: How about chaldean from Iraq. Let's ban them too. Can never be too safe.
1/28/17, 11:22 AM - Ziad Shounia: Hold on I got to run an errand
1/28/17, 11:22 AM - Ziad Shounia: Be back in an hour
1/28/17, 11:23 AM - Brandon Keina: Just message me. We can go back to talking about the future hall of famer osweiler
1/28/17, 11:23 AM - Ziad Shounia: Just one last comment. I hope our differences don't affect our friendship. I still love you and Bashar
1/28/17, 11:23 AM - Raymond Brikho: üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇ
1/28/17, 11:23 AM - Ziad Shounia: I wouldn't deport you üòÇüòÇ
1/28/17, 11:24 AM - Raymond Brikho: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 11:25 AM - Brandon Keina: Try loving all people equally.
1/28/17, 11:26 AM - Ziad Shounia: I do
1/28/17, 11:29 AM - Brandon Keina: Message me later, I'd love to hear how that's possible
1/28/17, 11:54 AM - Jason Qarana: Lmao
1/28/17, 11:54 AM - Jason Qarana: #fuckbashar
1/28/17, 2:04 PM - Bashar: Please hold whole I look up examples of immigrants from those 7 nations that aren't terrorists
1/28/17, 2:04 PM - Bashar: Whoa shit
1/28/17, 2:04 PM - Bashar: I found 7 people in this chat alone
1/28/17, 2:05 PM - Bashar: But yeah.... Let's bam them all because we're scared of a small minoritu
1/28/17, 2:05 PM - Bashar: Very christialike
1/28/17, 2:05 PM - Bashar: Fuck Swiftkey
1/28/17, 2:05 PM - Brandon Keina: Z doesn't believe in a permanent ban. We took it offline lol
1/28/17, 2:06 PM - Brandon Keina: Just more thorough vetting than there is now
1/28/17, 2:07 PM - Brandon Keina: And we both think trump went about it the wrong way with an all out ban immediately with no plan
1/28/17, 2:08 PM - Bashar: My main point,  Z,  yes there are bad apples,  every country,  every sect,  every religion,  every soccer club,  every church group,  every synagogue,  every school,  everywhere you get a group of people together.... There will be some that are bad and a bunch that aren't bad..... And doing an "all out" anything... Blanket decisions,  without understanding specific nuances just reeks of you not understanding the whole situation
1/28/17, 2:08 PM - Tom Brady: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 2:08 PM - Bashar: It's easy to hate Muslims and say ban all muslims
1/28/17, 2:09 PM - Bashar: That makes simple people feel better
1/28/17, 2:09 PM - Bashar: And it makes for a good headline and rallying cry
1/28/17, 2:09 PM - Brandon Keina: I said it was slightly fairer to ban everybody temporarily, not just Muslims. If it's just Muslims it's racist.
1/28/17, 2:10 PM - Brandon Keina: But I disagree with the full ban anyways.
1/28/17, 2:10 PM - Tom Brady: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 2:11 PM - Bashar: But in reality it's not a black and white issue....  The majority of people that apply for refugee or asylum status are fleeing war and oppression that's out of their control..... And saying "no,  you guys stay there and die because we're scared a bad apple might get in" is not the right answer.  Coupled with the fact that we already have a pretty thorough vetting process to accept refugees.
1/28/17, 2:12 PM - Ziad Shounia: For my own experience, both parents were dentists and taught in college. My dad had a master's degree from London. We are Christian family. None of that mattered in the 90s and early 2000s. It took them 15 years to vet us. And Iraq was much less threatening at the time than it is now.
1/28/17, 2:12 PM - Bashar: This is God damn america..... The statue of liberty says give me your tired,  your poor,  your hungry..... Not stay where you are and die because we're scared.
1/28/17, 2:12 PM - Ziad Shounia: This was a copy paste from my discussion with Brandon lol
1/28/17, 2:13 PM - Brandon Keina: Move to the political chat I just made. We'll spare the rest of the people this stuff lol
1/28/17, 2:13 PM - Bashar: It took me 10 years to get citizenship.... I was the last in my family
1/28/17, 2:14 PM - Ziad Shounia: In addition, Obama had his own executive order to make vetting easier and faster for refugees. I'm sure he had good intentions and trying to help people, but I think this might be compromising or security
1/28/17, 2:14 PM - Ziad Shounia: Lol nice bk
1/28/17, 2:14 PM - Brandon Keina: That's true actually. I looked it up
1/28/17, 2:14 PM - Bashar: But then we won't get sexy Ray bitmojis
1/28/17, 2:15 PM - Ziad Shounia: We will. Just say Detroit sucks
1/28/17, 2:15 PM - Brandon Keina: Damn. Never mind lets stay here
1/28/17, 2:15 PM - Bashar: If you say it,  he will cum
1/28/17, 2:18 PM - Bashar: https://apnews.com/9b2d6cbc974e46c197a41772ec34fc94/The-Latest:-Iran-suggests-it-will-limit-issuing-of-US-visas
1/28/17, 2:19 PM - Bashar: Great de-escelation
1/28/17, 2:19 PM - Bashar: True leadership shown here
1/28/17, 2:19 PM - Brandon Keina: What'd he say? Screw you we'll limit more?
1/28/17, 2:20 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: Social security numbers
1/28/17, 2:21 PM - Brandon Keina: Yea lol
1/28/17, 2:22 PM - Bashar: #fuckbashar
1/28/17, 2:24 PM - Cameron Smyth: I'll just leave this here
1/28/17, 2:24 PM - Cameron Smyth: https://twitter.com/chasestrangio/status/825111014492532736
1/28/17, 2:24 PM - Cameron Smyth: That's my contribution to this discussion lol
1/28/17, 2:24 PM - Bashar: Cam,  you're my favorite white guy.
1/28/17, 2:25 PM - Bashar: When I launch my terrorist attack.... I'll spare you
1/28/17, 2:25 PM - Brandon Keina: You're on another list now cam
1/28/17, 2:25 PM - Ziad Shounia: Cam is the only white guy that will get deported by trump
1/28/17, 2:26 PM - Cameron Smyth: I've had a good life here lol
1/28/17, 2:26 PM - Brandon Keina: I don't think refusing refugees is good but I also think we should learn from how badly things are going in Germany with having refugees not able to assimilate into their culture
1/28/17, 2:27 PM - Brandon Keina: There's a line we're nowhere near hitting. Trump was wrong, so was Germany
1/28/17, 2:27 PM - Ziad Shounia: It's too extremes
1/28/17, 2:27 PM - Ziad Shounia: Two*
1/28/17, 2:29 PM - Jakob Yonan: Where is the political chat
1/28/17, 2:31 PM - Brandon Keina: I left you out because you say dumb shit like this. And you think osweiler is Tom Brady
1/28/17, 2:32 PM - Bashar: Lmao
1/28/17, 2:32 PM - Christopher Guirlanda changed the subject from "Butthurt 3: Finding Jason" to "Butthurt 4: Terrorism"
1/28/17, 2:32 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: I'm interested in this political chat
1/28/17, 2:33 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: I'll take what you guys say and repeat then as alternative facts
1/28/17, 2:33 PM - Bashar: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 2:33 PM - Bashar: Seriously.... That comment was totally
1/28/17, 2:35 PM - Jason Qarana: Please
1/28/17, 2:36 PM - Brandon Keina: Done Jason lol
1/28/17, 2:37 PM - Jason Qarana: About time
1/28/17, 2:37 PM - Jakob Yonan: Question out to Bashar / Brandon ... how many truly Muslim friends do you have and how long have you known them for ? Muslims that pray 5x a day and have to go to mosque on Friday afternoon ... that when you visit their house don't let you see their wife ?
1/28/17, 2:37 PM - Jakob Yonan: Bashar Brandon I'm truly curious how many of these friends u have
1/28/17, 2:37 PM - Jason Qarana: Why is that relevant?
1/28/17, 2:38 PM - Jakob Yonan: It is ... because I used to think like Brandon and Bashar till I started to interact with them more and more
1/28/17, 2:38 PM - Jakob Yonan: And it changed my thinking
1/28/17, 2:38 PM - Jakob Yonan: So out curiosity
1/28/17, 2:38 PM - Jakob Yonan: How many do you know
1/28/17, 2:38 PM - Jason Qarana: Made you more racist?
1/28/17, 2:38 PM - Jakob Yonan: No it's not racist
1/28/17, 2:38 PM - Jakob Yonan: I have more Muslim friends than anyone in this chat
1/28/17, 2:39 PM - Jakob Yonan: I still talk to Mobarek
1/28/17, 2:39 PM - Ziad Shounia: I have friends that do but don't think they are bad
1/28/17, 2:39 PM - Jason Qarana: Judging people you don't know bc they are Muslim.... Pretty sure that's the definition of racism
1/28/17, 2:39 PM - Ziad Shounia: Just because they pray doesn't make them terrorists
1/28/17, 2:39 PM - Jakob Yonan: I'm not judging
1/28/17, 2:40 PM - Ziad Shounia: But I would say that following their religion to the T would make them hostile to non believers
1/28/17, 2:40 PM - Jakob Yonan: I'm saying they have different ideologies than American and have no internations of adopting our values
1/28/17, 2:40 PM - Jakob Yonan: Intentions
1/28/17, 2:40 PM - Jakob Yonan: Ziad Jason stop trying to change subject
1/28/17, 2:40 PM - Ziad Shounia: Sorry I'll stop talking here. Just wanted to mention my thoughts about what Jake said
1/28/17, 2:41 PM - Jakob Yonan: Brandon Bashar how many friends to you have that are extreme muslims and not moderate
1/28/17, 2:41 PM - Raymond Brikho: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 2:41 PM - Jakob Yonan: Their quietness means none
1/28/17, 2:42 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: Why is an extremist letting you in their home?
1/28/17, 2:42 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: Sounds pretty moderate
1/28/17, 2:42 PM - Ziad Shounia changed the subject from "Butthurt 4: Terrorism" to "Butthurt 4: just football"
1/28/17, 2:42 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: Z shouldn't it be butthurt 5?
1/28/17, 2:42 PM - Ziad Shounia: Let's not put terrorism on the chat title
1/28/17, 2:43 PM - Ziad Shounia: We are already flagged lol
1/28/17, 2:43 PM - Jakob Yonan: Because I'm an Iraqi habibi
1/28/17, 2:43 PM - Jakob Yonan: See Bashar and Brandon speak with no experience of interactions with extreme
1/28/17, 2:44 PM - Jakob Yonan: Yes moderate ones are really cool
1/28/17, 2:44 PM - Ziad Shounia: Prater 76 years field goal
1/28/17, 2:44 PM - Ziad Shounia: Tucker who
1/28/17, 2:44 PM - Jakob Yonan: And awesome ... but u can't base ur judgement on the moderate
1/28/17, 2:45 PM - Ziad Shounia: <Media omitted>
1/28/17, 2:47 PM - Brandon Keina: Lmao
1/28/17, 2:48 PM - Brandon Keina: üëÜüèº
1/28/17, 2:48 PM - Jakob Yonan: Keep dodging question Brandon lol
1/28/17, 2:48 PM - Brandon Keina: üëÜüèº
1/28/17, 2:49 PM - Jakob Yonan: Ok so 0 ... good to know
1/28/17, 2:51 PM - Bashar: Easy there tiger..... I just read the comments...lol

And you know I was born and raised in Baghdad,  right?
1/28/17, 2:51 PM - Brandon Keina: Check my Facebook. Also you're racist.
1/28/17, 2:51 PM - Jakob Yonan: Can't base an opinion without having interacted with an individual
1/28/17, 2:51 PM - Brandon Keina: Omar, Imran, mo, abrahim, and zee shan are some off the top of my head
1/28/17, 2:51 PM - Brandon Keina: So fuck off, racist.
1/28/17, 2:52 PM - Jakob Yonan: U have been over their house
1/28/17, 2:52 PM - Brandon Keina: Those were my childhood friends. You're racist
1/28/17, 2:52 PM - Jakob Yonan: And u they hid their mom / wife from u
1/28/17, 2:52 PM - Jakob Yonan: ?
1/28/17, 2:52 PM - Bashar: I lived in a predominately muslim country for the better part of my childhood,  never feared for my life in Iraq. Luckily we got out before the US got in again... Lol
1/28/17, 2:52 PM - Bashar: What's your point?
1/28/17, 2:52 PM - Brandon Keina: Their parents were all super friendly to me. Even fed me half the time when I was over
1/28/17, 2:52 PM - Jakob Yonan: Exactly they are not extreme
1/28/17, 2:53 PM - Jakob Yonan: Average muslims
1/28/17, 2:53 PM - Brandon Keina: So say it with me. You're racist
1/28/17, 2:53 PM - Jakob Yonan: Brandon ... I'm stating my opinion from my experience
1/28/17, 2:53 PM - Bashar: Oh so you're point is that you know one guy who is extreme.... So "literally 90%" are like that?
1/28/17, 2:53 PM - Jakob Yonan: Like u I was all for all muslims ... I interacted with extremist and saw their opinion ideologies
1/28/17, 2:53 PM - Jakob Yonan: Not one guy
1/28/17, 2:54 PM - Jakob Yonan: All the Yemenis from Dearborn
1/28/17, 2:54 PM - Bashar: Do you even known what "generalizations" and "racism" mean?
1/28/17, 2:54 PM - Bashar: Hahahahaba
1/28/17, 2:54 PM - Bashar: üëÜüèº
1/28/17, 2:54 PM - Jakob Yonan: Even ask Mobarek
1/28/17, 2:54 PM - Jakob Yonan: He is muslim right
1/28/17, 2:54 PM - Bashar: Thanks for proving my point immediately
1/28/17, 2:54 PM - Jakob Yonan: Does it make him a racist if he has same views towards extremist
1/28/17, 2:55 PM - Jakob Yonan: Extremist are dangerous to American views and values
1/28/17, 2:56 PM - Bashar: No one is arguing with you there.... It's when you say shit like "90%" and "all" that's the problem
1/28/17, 2:56 PM - Bashar: That's the racist oart
1/28/17, 2:56 PM - Bashar: Part
1/28/17, 2:56 PM - Jakob Yonan: https://youtu.be/AltyhmrIFgo
1/28/17, 2:56 PM - Bashar: You take a minority fact.... And. Are a broad assumption
1/28/17, 2:56 PM - Bashar: Just like "I watched 44 min of osweiller not sucking" so he must not be bad
1/28/17, 2:56 PM - Bashar: It's flawed logic buddy
1/28/17, 2:57 PM - Jakob Yonan: Ok let me correct ... 90% of extremist are bad
1/28/17, 2:58 PM - Bashar: Actually you are still wrong,  because 100% of extremists are bad
1/28/17, 2:59 PM - Bashar: But saying all (or 90%) of Muslims are extremists is incorrect.
1/28/17, 2:59 PM - Cameron Smyth: üëÜüèº
1/28/17, 3:04 PM - Tom Brady: I have a black friend so I can use the N word

1/28/17, 3:05 PM - Bashar: It impossible to Jake
1/28/17, 3:06 PM - Bashar: I've seen them exchange drugs for money right in front of me
1/28/17, 3:06 PM - Bashar: They shouldn't be allowed in the country
1/28/17, 3:06 PM - Bashar: All the Chaldeans in sterling heights are drug dealers
1/28/17, 3:06 PM - Bashar: They are extremists drug dealers
1/28/17, 3:07 PM - Bashar: See how stupid all that sounds,  Jake?
1/28/17, 3:07 PM - Bashar: That's how you sound
1/28/17, 3:08 PM - Bashar: I know a lot more Chaldeans who are drug dealers than Muslims who are terrorists
1/28/17, 3:09 PM - Bashar: Actually
1/28/17, 3:09 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: I know one dumb engineer at GM. They're all dumb engineers
1/28/17, 3:10 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: This game is fun
1/28/17, 3:10 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: I know one bashar on the FBI watch list. All bashars are in the FBI watch list

1/28/17, 3:22 PM - Jakob Yonan: Yeah Qatar Saudi Arabia / Dubai did not take in one Muslim refugee
1/28/17, 3:22 PM - Jakob Yonan: Does that make them racist ?
1/28/17, 3:22 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: Yes
1/28/17, 3:34 PM - Tom Brady: California leaving the US is gaining momentum.
1/28/17, 3:35 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: Bye Felicia

1/28/17, 3:40 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: So much for mine and Kathryn's honeymoon...
1/28/17, 3:44 PM - Jakob Yonan: Good ... less hostages they can take
1/28/17, 3:44 PM - Bashar: Are you seriously trying to use Saudia Arabia as the standard for morality for the US?
1/28/17, 3:45 PM - Jakob Yonan: Answer the question
1/28/17, 3:45 PM - Bashar: No one is arguing that Saudia Arabia is doing things right..... We are saying the US needs to be better than that
1/28/17, 3:45 PM - Bashar: Not stoop to their levek
1/28/17, 3:45 PM - Bashar: Level
1/28/17, 3:45 PM - Bashar: Was their a question?
1/28/17, 3:45 PM - Bashar: There *
1/28/17, 3:50 PM - Jakob Yonan: Yes do u think Saudi Arabia is racist because they are banning Muslim refugees

1/29/17, 1:44 PM - Jakob Yonan: I support all people coming to USA
1/29/17, 1:44 PM - Jakob Yonan: As long as they support the constitution of United States and hold our values

1/29/17, 1:44 PM - Jakob Yonan: I have no issues with Mexicans Chinese or any others coming in that support the constitution

1/29/17, 1:46 PM - Cameron Smyth: Nobody is saying to let extremists in
1/29/17, 1:46 PM - Cameron Smyth: But you can't just put a blanket ban on a religion
1/29/17, 1:46 PM - Bashar: I don't think he knows what extremists means
1/29/17, 1:47 PM - Brandon Keina: That's crazy talk cam
1/29/17, 1:47 PM - Cameron Smyth: Clearly

1/29/17, 1:49 PM - Cameron Smyth: üëÜüèº
1/29/17, 1:50 PM - Brandon Keina: If you're forcing somebody against their will that's a different story. Does he think everybody in an open relationship is going to hell?
1/29/17, 2:05 PM - Ziad Shounia: I myself disagree with Jake on this one
1/29/17, 2:05 PM - Ziad Shounia: Just because they follow some parts of their religion or customs doesn't mean they are terrorists or extremists
1/29/17, 2:07 PM - Ziad Shounia: People should have the freedom to practice their religion. It doesn't stop at attending prayer service. They should be allowed to do everything they want in their daily life so long as out does not negatively affect others
1/29/17, 2:07 PM - Ziad Shounia: We have freedom out religion, not just freedom of worship
1/29/17, 2:07 PM - Ziad Shounia: Of* religion

1/30/17, 7:08 PM - Brandon Keina: Yahoodism
1/30/17, 7:08 PM - Jakob Yonan: I said it to Brandon ... I don't agree with pope Francis

1/30/17, 7:15 PM - Jakob Yonan: Anyways I'm against extremist not Islam in general
1/30/17, 7:15 PM - Jakob Yonan: I'm done arguing
1/30/17, 7:15 PM - Brandon Keina: It's a 10 year average... Who cares about population with an average
1/30/17, 7:15 PM - Bashar: Lolwut
1/30/17, 7:16 PM - Brandon Keina: In yahoodism it makes sense. They practice statistics in preschool

1/30/17, 7:17 PM - Jakob Yonan: It's very small
1/30/17, 7:17 PM - Jakob Yonan: Compare it with German muslims vs total or French muslims vs total French population
1/30/17, 7:17 PM - Jakob Yonan: They have higher percent muslims
1/30/17, 7:17 PM - Brandon Keina: You could take terrorist attacks from around the entire globe and you'd still be more likely to be shot at random than killed in a terror attack
1/30/17, 7:17 PM - Jakob Yonan: Also look at who attacks christians
1/30/17, 7:18 PM - Jakob Yonan: Then ur statistics will change
1/30/17, 7:18 PM - Brandon Keina: They won't go after you don't worry, you're not a Christian
1/30/17, 7:18 PM - Jakob Yonan: As a liberal they u are I would expected that u look at both sides

1/30/17, 7:22 PM - Jakob Yonan: They have a good Islam population
1/30/17, 7:22 PM - Bashar: BK,  stop making yourself look stupid
1/30/17, 7:22 PM - Jakob Yonan: And tell me cases of attacks against Jews and christians
1/30/17, 7:22 PM - Bashar: Obviously your #s are wrong because they don't fit Jakes racist narrative
1/30/17, 7:22 PM - Jakob Yonan: Exactly u guys are blind
1/30/17, 7:23 PM - Bashar: Sided*
1/30/17, 7:23 PM - Jakob Yonan: Then when it's something u don't like or doesn't represent ur views then u say dumb shit

1/30/17, 7:23 PM - Bashar: Please tell me what dumb shit I've said
1/30/17, 7:23 PM - Bashar: I'll wait
1/30/17, 7:24 PM - Jakob Yonan: In a nutshell ur saying there is no risk of attacks by extremist in the us
1/30/17, 7:24 PM - Jakob Yonan: I'm saying that Islam population is very small
1/30/17, 7:24 PM - Brandon Keina: You literally post your feelings as facts.
1/30/17, 7:24 PM - Jakob Yonan: So u cannot just look at the cases but rather the percentage
1/30/17, 7:25 PM - Jakob Yonan: I'm done ... enjoys ur one sided views
1/30/17, 7:25 PM - You changed the subject from "Butthurt 5: The Jonkening" to "CNN vs FOX"
1/30/17, 7:28 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: I think everyone can agree that protecting America from terror attacks is the right thing to do.
1/30/17, 7:28 PM - Christopher Guirlanda: Can we agree?
